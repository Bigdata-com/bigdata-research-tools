Cookbooks
=========

This section provides practical cookbooks—concise, example-driven guides that demonstrate how to use functions and classes from the bigdata-research-tools package to build your own
research workflows. 

Each cookbook walks through a different workflow, showing how to work with the SDK’s building blocks—its classes, methods, and functions—to process data, interpret the output, and apply the results in a research context.

Narrative Miner
---------------
The first cookbook walks through how to track evolving narratives—such as concerns about an AI bubble—across news, transcripts, or filings using the NarrativeMiner class.
