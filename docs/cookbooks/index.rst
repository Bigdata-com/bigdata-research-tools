Cookbooks
=========

This section provides practical cookbooks—concise, example-driven guides that demonstrate how to use functions and classes from the bigdata-research-tools package to build your own
research workflows. 

Each cookbook walks through a different workflow, showing how to work with the SDK’s building blocks—its classes, methods, and functions—to process data, interpret the output, and apply the results in a research context.

Narrative Miner
---------------
Researchers, analysts, and decision-makers face the challenge of monitoring how key narratives evolve over time in an overwhelming sea of text data. The Narrative Miner provides a systematic approach to:

* Define a set of narratives you wish to track 
* Search and label transcripts, news, and filings data using the pre-defined narratives
* Compare narrative evolution across the different document types and time periods

Whether you're conducting academic research, market intelligence, policy analysis, or strategic planning, the Narrative Miner offers tools to transform unstructured text into structured insights about how stories evolve and spread.
